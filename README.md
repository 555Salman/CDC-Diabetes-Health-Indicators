# CDC-Diabetes-Health-Indicators
This task analyzes the CDC Diabetes dataset, explores features and distributions, preprocesses data, and builds a Decision Tree model to predict diabetes, evaluated with multiple metrics and cross-validation.


Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting millions worldwide, making early detection and management crucial for reducing associated health risks. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Diabetes Health Indicators dataset provides comprehensive information on various health and demographic indicators related to diabetes prevalence.

The objective of this task is to analyze the CDC Diabetes Health Indicators dataset, understand the variables and their distributions, and develop a predictive model to classify individuals based on diabetes-related health indicators. This involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature-label separation, and evaluation of feature importance using information gain. A Decision Tree classifier will be built and optimized using training, validation, and test datasets, with performance evaluated through metrics such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Additionally, 5-Fold Cross Validation will be applied to assess model robustness and explore possible improvements before submission.

This study not only highlights the importance of structured data analysis in health informatics but also demonstrates the practical application of machine learning techniques for predictive healthcare modeling.
